```

## Project Structure
```
days
â”œâ”€â”€day01/
   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt    # Paste your puzzle input here
   â””â”€â”€ main.cpp     # Write your solution here
```

## Building & Running

```bash
cd dayXX
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

## Progress

- Day 1: Just starting

## Notes

- Using C++17 because modern enoughâ„¢
- macOS + Clang because life is already complicated enough
- No build system because this isn't enterprise software
- No fancy optimizations because AoC inputs are small
